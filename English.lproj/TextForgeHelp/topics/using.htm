It was built to   keep advanced features from cluttering up its interface, yet have them readily  available  to those  who want  to use  them. Document windows are simple and uncluttered - most of the functionality  is packed up in the menus. All commonly used commands have keyboard shortcuts.  In order to maximize your TextForge experience, spend some time tweaking things  in the preferences. If you have any ideas about how to improve TextForge's  user experience, please let me know (josha@mac.com).</p><p><a href="../TFHelp.htm">Click here</a> to go back to TextForge's help topics.</p><hr><p align="center">Copyright &copy;2003-2004 Trance Software</p></body></html>
