I have worked very hard to get  the bugs out of TextForge, and there's nothing I like more than squashing the  ones the slip by me. Please send the following information when reporting  a bug:</p><ul>  <li>A very detailed description of how to reproduce the bug</li>  <li>Your OS version, and any modifications you have made to your OS and/or    the Finder. This includes most Unsanity products, and products that &quot;Theme&quot;    the finder</li>  <li>The type of computer you have (e.g. PowerBook G4/667 w/512mb RAM)</li>  <li>Any text files you think would be helpful in reproducing/illustrating the    bug</li></ul><p>Send this information to &quot;christian@trancesoftware.com&quot; - I will reply quickly and if the  bug is really a bug he will fix it ASAP.
